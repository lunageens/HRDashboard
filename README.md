**Juypter Notebook:** First, we have scraped vacancies from the websites of PwC, Deloitte, KPMG, and EY. 
Secondly, we classify them with a public Huggingface model to see which job field, domain and title the vacancy is about. 
Thirdly, I write a CSV file with the predictions and vacancies in it to my local computer. I have added those to this Github repo.
Lastly, I write a Python file with the code for the dashboard and download it to my local computer. I have also added this file to this Github repo.

**Requirements**: Wrote this in Notepad and added to Github repo. 

Lastly, I connect Github repo to Streamlit Cloud Community to host dashboard locally. This is done on their website by making a free account and adding a new app like this:
